I am Shriram Chandran, a Computer Science MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch), majoring in Secure and Reliable Systems and aiming to obtain a minor in Theoretical Computer Science. I am currently working on my Master’s thesis, focusing on graph databases.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/), graduating in 2022.

I am looking for full-time opportunities. My research interests lie in high-performance computing and data management systems. I am particularly excited about heterogeneous and distributed computing environments and their potential to accelerate data management systems. Feel free to reach out via email, or connect with me on LinkedIn.
