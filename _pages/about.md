I am Shriram Chandran, a Computer Science MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch), majoring in Secure and Reliable Systems, and aiming to get a minor in Theoretical Computer Science. I am currently working on my Master's Thesis, working on graph databases.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/), from where I graduated in 2022.

I am looking for full-time opportunities. My research interests lie in the fields of high-performance computing and data management systems. I'm particularly excited by heterogeneous and distributed computing environments and their potential to accelerate data management systems. I am happy to get in touch on email, or you can also connect with me through LinkedIn.
