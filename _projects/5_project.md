I worked with Godot Media, a Bengaluru-based startup in the winter of 2021, on a 6-week software internship. With Godot, I designed and constructed an automatic plagiarism checker capable of searching text against documents on the internet. I had to implement multiple heuristics to increase accuracy and reduce latency by parallelization. In the end, we managed to return quick match scores and highlighted match results with high accuracy, on articles of up to 2000 words in just a few seconds.

The following summer, I worked with Rubrik's Bangalore office on an 11-week software internship with the Blobstore team, as a part of which we aimed to develop a system to analyze key statistics (such as runtime, memory savings, etc.) for operations performed on data chains, such as aggregates, deletes, or reverses. I designed a functional model for computing these statistics and storing them within their respective databases, ensuring that the system or clients could efficiently track and manage the data from these operations. The model was fully integrated with the existing Blobstore system. As a result, the system provided better monitoring and optimization of data chain operations.
