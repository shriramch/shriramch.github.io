In my final year at IIT Madras, I worked with [Prof. Raghavendra Rao](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~bvrr/), on stable instances of graph algorithms. Stability is promising since real-life graph datasets in many algorithms tend to occur with a certain degree of stability to perturbations, unlike worst-case graph instances. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of previous research on stability and then analyzed stable instances of Christofidesâ€™ algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) under different stability conditions. We managed to identify improved approximation bounds for stable instances of the algorithm with 2 different definitions of stability. Later, we also covered approximation algorithms and conducted analyses of almost stable instances in random graphs for the vertex cover problem.
