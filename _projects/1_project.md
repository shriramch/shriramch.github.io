After finishing my coursework at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I joined [Prof. Torsten Hoefler](https://htor.ethz.ch/)'s SPCL for my master's thesis, under the supervision of [Maciej Besta](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/bestam/) and [Marcin Copik](https://mcopik.github.io/). We aim to design, implement, and benchmark a higher-order graph database engine, owing to surging interest in AI and other processing systems working on higher-order graph-structured data. After spending a good few weeks studying the theory behind different higher-order graph structures, graph databases, graph neural networks, and analytics, I worked on plain graph embeddings for higher-order graphs and performance models under various workloads, graph structures, and database storage formats. Then, we set out to implement a fully functioning database with OLTP capabilities on top of Neo4j. In the future, we plan on implementing a few OLAP workloads and finally benchmarking. I look forward to achieving great results!
