I started my B. Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering on 31 July 2018 at IIT Madras! I had a great performance out of high school, with 2 KVPY scholarships, qualifying to the training camp for the International Physics and Astronomy Olympiads, and getting an AIR 74 in JEE (Advanced 2018).
